# Space Exploration Site

Welcome to my project!

I created this small project while learning Basics of HTML / CSS through @Scrimba. This project is meant to showcase my progress and skills as I continue to learn and grow in the field of frontend development. I hope you find it interesting and useful. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting!
